For a full parts list with purchase links, see the [parts guide](https://serin-labs.github.io/parts). For compatible models, see the [compatibility list](https://serin-labs.github.io/compatibility) or the [MitsubishiCN105ESPHome supported units list](https://github.com/echavet/MitsubishiCN105ESPHome?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-mitsubishi-climate-units). Not every unit supports every feature (outside temperature, half-degree precision, wide vane control); it varies by model.

### Software

- [ESP-IDF v5.5](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5/) (build framework)
- Python 3 (for HTML embedding script)

### Boards

| Board | Target | Build command | Tested |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|
| M5Stack NanoC6 (ESP32-C6) | `esp32c6` | `idf.py set-target esp32c6 && idf.py build` | ✅ |
| M5Stack Atom S3 Lite (ESP32-S3) | `esp32s3` | `idf.py set-target esp32s3 && idf.py build` | ✅ |
| ESP32-C3 SuperMini / XIAO | `esp32c3` | `idf.py set-target esp32c3 && idf.py build` | ❌ |
| Generic ESP32 DevKit | `esp32` | `idf.py set-target esp32 && idf.py build` | ❌ |

Board profiles define GPIO pins, LED, button, UART clock source, and debug output for each target. See `main/boards/` for details, or the [Custom Board Guide](docs/custom-boards.md) to add a new board.

## Wiring

Connect the M5Stack NanoC6 to the CN105 connector on the indoor unit's control board using the Grove port. For detailed wiring photos and diagrams, see the [wiring guide](https://serin-labs.github.io/wiring).

```
CN105 Connector          M5Stack NanoC6 (Grove)
┌──────────────┐
│ Pin 1 — 12V  │         ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Pin 2 — GND ─┼─────────┼─ GND (Black)         │
│ Pin 3 — 5V  ─┼─────────┼─ 5V  (Red)           │
│ Pin 4 — TX  ─┼─────────┼─ GPIO2 / RX (White)  │
│ Pin 5 — RX  ─┼─────────┼─ GPIO1 / TX (Yellow) │
└──────────────┘         └──────────────────────┘
```

The CN105 connector is typically located on the right side of ductless indoor unit's control board behind the front panel. Power is provided by the unit through pins 2 and 3. If your board doesn't have a Grove port, you can connect directly to the appropriate GPIO pins for RX/TX, GND, and 5V (see [board profiles](#boards)).

## Setup

### 1. Flash Firmware

**Option A — Web Flasher (recommended):**

No tools to install. Visit the [web flasher](https://serin-labs.github.io/flash), connect your board via USB, select your board type, and click flash. Works in Chrome and Edge.

**Option B — ESP-IDF (developers):**

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/akifbayram/mitsubishi-cn105-homekit.git
cd mitsubishi-cn105-homekit

# Activate ESP-IDF environment
source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

# Build for default board (NanoC6 / ESP32-C6)
idf.py set-target esp32c6
idf.py build

# Flash via USB
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash

# Monitor serial output
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 monitor
```

### 2. WiFi Provisioning

On first boot, the device creates a WiFi access point:

1. Connect to the **Serin-XXXX** network (XXXX = last 4 hex digits of WiFi MAC, password: `serinlabs`)
2. A captive portal appears. Enter your WiFi SSID and password
3. The device saves credentials to flash and reboots
4. A unique 8-digit HomeKit setup code is auto-generated on first boot

<img src="media/recovery.png" width=300>

**Build-time WiFi (optional):** To skip the captive portal during development, pass WiFi credentials as CMake flags:

```bash
idf.py -DWIFI_SSID="MyNetwork" -DWIFI_PASSWORD="MyPassword" build
```

The device will connect automatically on boot. WiFi can still be changed later via the web UI.

### 3. WiFi Recovery

If the device loses WiFi, it spins up a fallback AP (**Serin-XXXX**) after 5 minutes while still trying to reconnect in the background. Three recovery options:

| Layer | Method | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Auto AP** | Automatic | Fallback AP activates after 5 min disconnect (2 min after a credential change). Disables automatically when WiFi reconnects. |
| **Recovery page** | Web browser | Connect to the AP and navigate to `192.168.4.1` to enter new WiFi credentials. |
| **Button reset** | Physical | 10-second long-press on the board button (e.g., GPIO9 on NanoC6) erases stored WiFi credentials. Only available on boards with a button. |

### 4. HomeKit Pairing

<img src="media/homekit.png" width=300>

Once connected to WiFi:

**Option A — Scan QR Code (recommended):**

1. Scan the QR code shown in the web UI at `http://<device-ip>` (HomeKit panel)

**Option B — Manual setup code:**

1. Open the **Home** app on your iPhone or iPad
2. Tap **+** > **Add Accessory**
3. Select **Mini Split XXXX** (or tap **More options…** if it doesn't appear)
4. Enter the setup code shown in the web UI (HomeKit panel > Setup Code)

### 5. Status LEDs

On boards with an RGB LED:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| White blink | Booting |
| Red steady | CN105 disconnected |
| Red fast blink | Error |
| Blue pulse | OTA in progress |
| Off | Normal operation |

On the NanoC6, a separate blue LED tracks WiFi (on = disconnected, off = connected). Boards without a blue LED show WiFi disconnect as steady blue on the RGB LED instead (vs pulsing blue for OTA).

## Remote Temperature Sensor (BLE)

Wall-mounted units measure temperature at ceiling height near the return air intake, which usually reads warmer than the living space. A BLE sensor placed lower in the room gives the heat pump a better reading to work with.

The firmware listens for BLE advertisements from a configured sensor. No Bluetooth pairing needed, just power on the sensor. Temperature is forwarded to the heat pump every 20 seconds. If no BLE data arrives before the stale timeout (default 10 minutes, adjustable from 30 seconds to 10 minutes via the Remote Sensor card), the heat pump reverts to its internal thermistor.

The sensor also shows up in Apple Home as its own accessory (separate from the climate tile) reporting temperature, humidity, and battery level. Home shows a low-battery warning when the cell drops to 20% or below.

### Supported Sensors

The firmware auto-detects the sensor type from the BLE advertisement format.

| Protocol | Devices | Tested |
|----------|---------|:------:|
| Govee V3 | H5072, H5075 | ❌ |
| Govee V2 | H5074, H5051, H5052, H5071 | ✅ |
| Govee V1 | H5100, H5101, H5102, H5103, H5104, H5105, H5108, H5110, H5174, H5177, GV5179 | ✅ |
| PVVX | Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC, CGG1 (requires [PVVX custom firmware](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer)) | ❌ |
| SwitchBot | Meter (W2300000), Meter Plus (W2301500), Meter Pro (W4900010) ✅, Meter Pro CO2 (W4900030), Indoor/Outdoor Meter (W3400010) | ✅ |
| BTHome v2 | Shelly BLU H&T, or any BTHome v2 device | ❌ |

### Web UI Configuration

A **Remote Sensor** card appears in the web UI on boards with Bluetooth:

- **MAC Address** — enter or change the sensor's BLE MAC address (persisted to flash)
- **Feed Toggle** — enable/disable sending the sensor temperature to the heat pump (disabling the feed keeps scanning and displaying sensor data, it just stops overriding the HP's internal thermistor)
- **Status** — live temperature, humidity, battery level, signal strength, and last update time
- **Indicators** — green (active), orange (feed disabled), red (stale data), gray (scanning/not configured)

## Display Link Remote (ESP-NOW)

An optional M5Dial gives the headless unit a physical control surface over an **encrypted 1:1 ESP-NOW link**. The Dial mirrors live state and can change power, mode, setpoint, fan, and vanes; all HVAC logic stays on the unit. The link is idle until a Dial is bonded, so a unit with no remote behaves exactly as before.

**Pairing:** Hold the unit's button to open a pairing window (LED feedback), then pair from the Dial — or provision both at a bench with `scripts/pair_dial.sh`. "Forget remote" in the web UI clears the bond.

### Firmware compatibility

The unit and the Dial run separate firmwares that update independently (the unit via OTA, the Dial via USB), so the two ends are routinely a version apart between updates. The ESP-NOW wire protocol is versioned to tolerate that instead of going dark:

- **Compatibility floor** — each firmware declares the oldest peer protocol version it can still parse (`ESPNOW_PROTO_MIN_COMPAT`). Any peer at or above the floor is accepted; the receiver reads the fields it understands and ignores anything newer it doesn't. Only a **breaking** layout change raises the floor.
- **Additive changes are free** — a new flag bit in a byte with room, a byte claimed from a packet's `reserved[]` tail, or a field appended to a packet bumps the protocol version but **not** the floor, so a peer one (or more) versions behind keeps working.
- **Reserved growth room (proto v6)** — every data packet carries a small zero-filled `reserved[]` tail, so most future fields change no packet sizes at all. Length checks are pinned to the floor-era minimum sizes (`ESPNOW_*_MIN_LEN`, not `sizeof`), and decode is zero-fill + prefix-copy (`espnow_decode_pkt`), so both shorter old packets and longer future packets parse.
- **Skew is visible, not silent** — when a bonded peer is seen on a different protocol version, both sides log a throttled warning naming which end (Dial or unit) should be updated, rather than dropping its packets without explanation.
- **Pairing and keepalive bypass the floor** — so an out-of-date remote is still *seen* (and can be told to update) instead of vanishing entirely.

This means an OTA that bumps the unit's protocol version with an additive change will not brick an already-paired Dial; a breaking change (rare) requires reflashing both, and the log warning makes the mismatch obvious.

> **v5 → v6 flag day:** v6 added the `reserved[]` tails, which grew packet sizes. A v6 *receiver* still parses v5 senders (floor stays at 5), but v5 *receivers* version-gate strictly and drop v6 frames — so a v5 Dial shows NOLINK against a v6 unit until reflashed. Update the Dial together with (or before) the unit OTA. This is the last planned size-changing bump; from v6 on, growth happens inside the reserved tails.

## OTA Updates

Update firmware over the air without USB access:

**Via Web UI:**
Navigate to `http://<device-ip>`, open Settings, and use the Firmware Update section. The browser computes a SHA256 checksum before uploading, and the device verifies integrity before applying.

**Via curl:**
```bash
idf.py build
curl --data-binary @build/mitsubishi-cn105-homekit.bin \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     http://<device-ip>/upload
```

**Check for updates:** The web UI Settings panel has a "Check for Updates" button. Your browser fetches the release manifest, compares it against the running version, and offers a one-click install when a newer build is available (the device itself does no GitHub I/O). This is hidden on custom and untracked builds.

**Rollback protection:** After an OTA update, the device checks that WiFi and CN105 UART still work before confirming the new firmware. If it reboots before that check passes (crash, power loss), it rolls back to the previous firmware.

## Web UI

Access the web interface at `http://<device-ip>`.

The web UI includes:

- **Mode** — Off/Heat/Cool/Auto/Dry/Fan mode selector (power integrated as Off mode)
- **Temperature** — set target temperature with 0.5°C precision, +/− step buttons
- **Dual Setpoints** — independent heat/cool thresholds in Auto mode, set with a single min/max range slider (persisted to flash)
- **Fan Speed** — Auto, Quiet, Speed 1–4
- **Vane Control** — vertical and wide vane positions, swing mode
- **Remote Sensor** — BLE sensor temperature, humidity, battery, signal strength, MAC config, feed toggle, stale timeout (only visible when built with BLE support)
- **Diagnostics** — compressor frequency, outside temp, runtime hours, error codes, sub mode/stage
- **HomeKit** — pairing status, controller count, setup code with copy button, QR code for pairing, reset pairing button
- **Settings** — device name, poll interval (ms), log level, °C/°F toggle
- **Logs** — real-time log streaming via WebSocket
- **OTA** — firmware upload with integrity verification, plus a "Check for Updates" button for one-click upgrades (see [OTA Updates](#ota-updates))

## HomeKit Details

The device pairs as a HomeKit bridge (the bridge runs on the ESP32 itself, no separate hardware). The air conditioner and the BLE remote sensor appear as two distinct accessories behind a single pairing. Every service reports a connection state, so the Home app marks an accessory "Not Responding" when the CN105 link or BLE sensor drops.

Thermostat mode mappings, FAN/DRY mode switches, fan speed percentages, dual setpoints, vane control, and diagnostics are documented in [HomeKit Details](docs/homekit.md). For an overview of HomeKit features and setup, see the [Serin Labs HomeKit page](https://serin-labs.github.io/homekit/features).
